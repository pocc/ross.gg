I gravitate toward games with deep strategic decision-making: economic engines, area control, and abstract two-player games. The best board games create meaningful decisions where every choice has real consequences.

Current rotation includes Brass: Birmingham for heavy economic strategy, Hive for quick abstract duels, and Spirit Island for cooperative play.
