## About this blog

This blog has articles on things that interest me. I have experience with Math,
Networking, Python, and Linux. Expect to find posts on these types of topics.

## About me

I am a Network Engineer at Cisco Meraki
where I enjoy solving networking problems. I currently live in San
Francisco and enjoy the foggy climate. In my downtime, I like working
on programming side-projects.

## Open Source

I like contributing back to my tools. Among others, I have contributed to these projects:
[Wireshark](https://wireshark.org), [Termshark](https://termshark.io/), [tutorialedge.net](https://tutorialedge.net),
and [termstandard/colors](https://github.com/termstandard/colors).

_CR6 bug I fixed in Wireshark. CRC6 is used for MBMS SYNC, which is a multicast LTE SYNC protocol._

I am also the author of [tshark.dev](https://tshark.dev), a website dedicated to the Pcap Lifecycle.
