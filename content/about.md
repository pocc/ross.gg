## About me

<img src="/img/profile_pic_eff.jpg" alt="Profile pic EFF" style="float:right; margin-left:20px; display:block;width:35%;"/>

I work at Cloudflare helping customers make their websites more performant. 
In my free time, I like building things with code. See [/projects](/projects) for showcases and 
[github](https://github.com/pocc) for all the things I've built. I have most experience with bash, python, golang, typescript, but it's best to use the right tool for the job. 

I like finding the optimal path, which is why I like to play board games. Given a set of starting conditions, there will always be a best move. Just like tech, you have to play the game to get a handle on the universe of moves.

[Résumé](/resume.pdf) for those who want it.

## Open Source

I like contributing back to my tools. Among others, I have contributed to these projects:
[Wireshark](https://wireshark.org), [Termshark](https://termshark.io/), [tutorialedge.net](https://tutorialedge.net),
and [termstandard/colors](https://github.com/termstandard/colors).

_CR6 bug I fixed in Wireshark. CRC6 is used for MBMS SYNC, which is a multicast LTE SYNC protocol._
