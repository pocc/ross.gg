## About me

<img src="/img/profile_pic_eff.jpg" alt="Ross Jacobs" style="float:right; margin-left:20px; display:block; width:35%; border-radius:1rem;"/>

I'm a Customer Solutions Engineer at Cloudflare, where I help customers make their websites more performant and secure. I understand L3, L4, and L7 deeply — from 802.11 frames to TLS handshakes to HTTP caching strategies.

In my free time, I build things with code. See [tools.ross.gg](https://tools.ross.gg) for showcases and [GitHub](https://github.com/pocc) for everything I've built.

I love looking at hexdumps because flags and options are bits and bytes that constitute the various layers. I read RFCs because they hold the ultimate truth on how protocols should work. Always focus on the root problem. PCAPs or it didn't happen.

Beyond tech, I'm into strategy board games (especially economic euros like Brass: Birmingham), tea culture (mostly oolong, brewed gongfu style), and home automation with Zigbee and ESP32.

[Resume](/resume.pdf) for those who want it.

## Open Source

I like contributing back to my tools. Among others, I have contributed to
[Wireshark](https://wireshark.org), [Termshark](https://termshark.io/), [tutorialedge.net](https://tutorialedge.net),
and [termstandard/colors](https://github.com/termstandard/colors).

*CRC6 bug I fixed in Wireshark. CRC6 is used for MBMS SYNC, which is a multicast LTE SYNC protocol.*

## Projects
