## About this blog

This blog has articles on things that interest me. I have experience with Math,
Networking, Python, and Linux. Expect to find posts on these types of topics.

## About me

I am a networking and programming enthusiast who enjoys learning new things. I
graduated in 2016 from Sonoma State University with a degree in Math and
Computer Science. Since 2017, I have been a Network Engineer at Cisco Meraki
where I enjoy solving complex networking problems. I currently live in San
Francisco and enjoy the foggy climate. In my downtime, I like scripting to
automate the small stuff.

My philosophy on programming is to plan the requirements and then just do it.
