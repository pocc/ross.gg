## About me

I work fulltime for Cloudflare as a Technical Support Engineer.

Formerly, I was a Network Engineer at Cisco Meraki
where I enjoyed solving networking problems. 

## Open Source

I like contributing back to my tools. Among others, I have contributed to these projects:
[Wireshark](https://wireshark.org), [Termshark](https://termshark.io/), [tutorialedge.net](https://tutorialedge.net),
and [termstandard/colors](https://github.com/termstandard/colors).

_CR6 bug I fixed in Wireshark. CRC6 is used for MBMS SYNC, which is a multicast LTE SYNC protocol._

I am also the author of [tshark.dev](https://tshark.dev), a website dedicated to the Pcap Lifecycle.
