## About me

<img src="/img/profile_pic_eff.jpg" alt="Profile pic EFF" style="float:right; margin-left:20px; display:block;width:35%;"/>

I work at Cloudflare helping customers make their websites more performant. I understand L3, L4, and L7 deeply. In my free time, I like building things with code. See [tools.](https://tools.ross.gg) for showcases and [github](https://github.com/pocc) for all the things I've built.

I love to look at hexdumps because flags and options are bits and bytes that constitute the various layers. I like to read RFCs, because they hold the ultimate truth on how protocols should work. Always focus on the root problem. PCAPs or it didn't happen.

[Résumé](/resume.pdf) for those who want it.

## Open Source

I like contributing back to my tools. Among others, I have contributed to these projects:
[Wireshark](https://wireshark.org), [Termshark](https://termshark.io/), [tutorialedge.net](https://tutorialedge.net),
and [termstandard/colors](https://github.com/termstandard/colors).

_CR6 bug I fixed in Wireshark. CRC6 is used for MBMS SYNC, which is a multicast LTE SYNC protocol._
