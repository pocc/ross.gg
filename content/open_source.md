## Open Source Contributions

### Wireshark
`git clone https://code.wireshark.org/review/wireshark`

Per their website, [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is the
worldâ€™s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. As part of
my role as a Network Engineer at Meraki, I use it on a daily basis. I
wanted to give back, so I donated time to Wireshark.


**Commits**

  lookup table and functions.  
  *CRC6 is used for MBMS SYNC, which is a
  multicast LTE SYNC protocol.*

and inspired this website.
