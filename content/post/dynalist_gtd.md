I like using Dynalist and can easily see how GTD can be applied to it. I would
also like to learn about how to use GTD.

I think most importantly though, it is importnat to be able to define boundaries
of how to use a program. A program like Dynalist that is so freeform makes it
harder to nail down a system that best utilizes it.
