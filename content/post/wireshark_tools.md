There are many wireshark command line utilities. I plan on going over how to use
them as part of networking troubleshooting and pcap munging.

These are the existing builtins (and many date from the early 2000's):

- capinfos
- dumpcap
- editcap
- mergecap
- randpkt
- rawshark
- reordercap
- text2pcap
- tshark

## capinfos

## dumpcap

## editcap

## randpkt
