# Making a Julia Binary
_Compile your Julia project with PackageCompiler for portability and speed._

Julia is a JIT language; however, sometimes it might be nice to have an
executable. There are two ways to interact with PackageCompiler: Using the CLI
using `juliac` and by adding PackageCompiler as part of your script. This
article will go over both.

## Initial Setup

1. [Install Julia 1.1.0](https://julialang.org/downloads/) if not installed
2. Install PackageCompiler and Deps

```julia
# ArgParse is required for PackageCompiler
julia -e 'using Pkg; 
		  Pkg.add("ArgParse");
		  Pkg.add("PackageCompiler")'
```

### Alias PackageCompiler to `juliac`

The full command to compile is `julia /variable/path/to/juliac.jl`. The path to
this file is dependent on where PackageCompiler is stored and different on every
system. We are going to save time by using an alias.

_Use your shell of choice below_

#### bash
   
```bash
$ juliac_path='julia -e println(normpath(Base.find_package(\
	"PackageCompiler"),"..", "..")'
$ echo "julia ${juliac_path}juliac.jl" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

#### powershell
	
```powershell
PS> $juliac_dir = julia -e 'println(normpath(Base.find_package(`
		\"PackageCompiler\"),\"..\",\"..\"))'
PS> Set-Alias julia "${juliac_dir}juliac.jl" 
```

## Hello World!

### Code

No introduction is complete without a Hello World. In this example, we'll
compile a Julia version. 

```
# hello_world.jl

function AwesomeFuntion()
  println("Hello World!")
end

# Required PackageCompiler boilerplate 
Base.@ccallable function julia_main(ARGS::Vector{String})::Cint
    AwesomeFunction()
    return 0
end
```

### Compiling

We will use `juliac hello_world.jl -tavern hello_world` to generate the
executable. I will cover options here briefly for sake of completeness
(use `juliac -h` for full details).

- __-t__ Remove temp build files 
- __-a__ Automatically build required dependencies
- __-v__ Verbose
- __-e__ Make executable
- __-r__ Implies -O3 -g0 [Max (-O)ptimize and debu(-g) at the lowest level]
- __-n__ Output file name

Time to compile will be several minutes, so go grab a â˜•!

_Once it has compiled, execute it_:

```bash
$ cd builddir  # builddir is default output directory
$ ./hello_world
Hello World!
```

### Packaging

The two relevant files in builddir are `hello_world` and a dynamically linked
library, `hello_world.$(dll)`. We can use a wildcard to tar both of them.

`tar -cvzf hello_world.tar.gz builddir/*`

To end result shoud be approximately 26MB, regardless of system.

## Conclusion

In this article, we constructed a Julia binary In my [second article](/tbd) on the
topic, I explore how to encapsulate Julia's Calculus library into a CLI utility.
