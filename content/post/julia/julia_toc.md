_The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Julia!_

This guide came about because there is a lack of unifying documentation for
Julia. The [official docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) are good for
documenting language features, but not so much best practices. I like Kenneth
Reitz's work on the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python and want to replicate it for
Julia.

This is a work in progress (2/23 => 9% done). Articles not written look [like
this]().
