There are many wireshark command line utilities. I plan on going over how to use
them as part of networking troubleshooting and pcap munging.

This article is focused on different packet libraries like Google's Go Packet
library, Python's PyShark and Scapy. 

Things I care about:
* Speed
* Capabilities
