_Packet Analysis, Scripted_

In line with the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing well", Wireshark has many
small CLI utilities. I assume that you are reading this article because you know
how to use Wireshark and want to know how to do X with the CLI. 

## capinfos
Get info about a packet capture

## dumpcap
Utility that other Wireshark utilities use to capture packets 

## editcap
Edit the attributes of a 

## mergecap
Merge two or more packet captures together

## randpkt
Generate packets

## rawshark
Never used it

## reordercap
Sometimes packets are out of order. Reordercap fixes that.

## text2pcap
Convert a hexstring into a packet capture

This article does not cover tshark for reasons of brevity. Continue the journey
at the [tshark page]()

## Closing Thoughts

Personally, I think that wireshark's CLI needs a better API. For example, git
has a large amount of functionality, but.

One example

The current system works, but is not the most intuitive.
