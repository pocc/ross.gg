## Drafting

### Prewriting

#### Article Ideas

1. How does Julia compare in terms of performance to other languages?
2. How does Julia work under the hood? Compared to Python?
3. How do more advanced concepts work? What can you do in Julia that you can't
   in other languages?
4. What are the major Julia libraries in 2019 (with examples)?
5. Hitchhiker's Guide to Julia
6. Python vs Julia feature comparison (i.e. SymPy, Numpy, etc.)

#### Audience: Julia users

Julia users are largely Python (and occasionally R) users. Articles should use
metaphors from those languages. Many Julia users are learning it for the first
time, so articles that make basic usage easier will be good.

**Niche**

What makes this unique compared to existing articles?
